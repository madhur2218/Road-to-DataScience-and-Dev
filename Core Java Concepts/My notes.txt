Types of languages : 
	1. Procedural - java, python
	2. Functional - python
	3. Object Oriented - java, python
	
-Statically and Dynamically typed languages:





-Java Architecture/How java code executes:
	-.java file is human redable file and is our source code.
	-Java compiler (compiler exexutes entire file) converts the .java code not directly into machine redable code in 0 AND 1 but 
	  it converts it into .class (byte code) file
	-This .class file cannot run on system, we need JVM to run this and thats why Java is platform independent.
	-Then java interpreter(executes code line by line) converts this code into Machine code in 1 and 0 format.
	
More on platform independence:
	1. Means that byte code (.class file) can run on all opertaing systems.
	2.We need to convert this source code to machine code for machine to understand.
	3.Compiler helps in doing this by converting it into executable code.
	4.After compiling C/C++ code we get an .exe file which is platform dependent(ie. on windeows it will run but in mac it will not run, we will have to ocmpile this code again to run it)
	5.In java, we get this bytecode(.class file) and JVM converts this into machine code.
	6. Java is platform independent but JVM is platform dependent.(ie. i got my class file in windows which jvm will interpret in windows but this class file will remain same but jvm would be different in case for mac.)
	
JDK vs JRE vs JVM 
	1. jdk(java devlopment kit)= jre(java runtime environment) + devlopment tools.
	2. jre(java runtime environment) = jvm(java virtual machine) + library classes
	
JDK
	1.Provides environment(package/files)to devlop and run java code.
	2.JDK is a package which includes:
		-devlopment tools - to provide environment to devlop programme.
		-JRE - to execute programme
		- compiler - javac (this converts java code to byte code)
		-archiver - jar
		-docs generator - javadoc
		-interpreter/loader
JRE	
	1.Installation papckage that provides environment to only run the programme.
	2.It consists of:
		-Deployment tech
		-User interface
		-Integration lib/base lib/base
		-JVM
	3.After we get the .class file, next thing happens at run time:
		-Class loader executes all the classes needed to execute the programme.
		-JVM sends code to byte code verifier to check for format of code.
		- More like a box and jvm is the actual content inside this box.
		
JVM: responsible for executing the code line by line.
	whatever work jvm is doing it is doing with help of libraries provided by jre.
		
What happens at Compile and Run time:

	Compile Time:  [.java file] (javac compilation) ->.class file
	Run Time    :  Class loader -> byteCode Veryfier -> Interpreter -> Runtime-> Hardware
	
How JVM works:
	1. Class Loader
		-Loading:
			-reads .class file and generates binary data.
			-an object of this class file is created in heap.
		-Linking:
			-JVM verifies this .class file
			-allocates memory for class variables and default values.
			-replace symbolic references from type with direct references.
		-Initialization:
			-All static variables are assigned with their values defined in the code and static block.
		JVM contains stack and heap memory allocations.
	2.JVM Evecution
		Interpreter:
				-Line by line execution
				-When one method is called many times,it interprets again and again.
	3.JIT(just in time env): those methods that are repeated, JIT provides direct machine code so re-interpretataion is not required.
			Makes execution faster
			Garbage collection
				
Steps: 1.Java source code 
	   2. JDK 
	   3. ByteCode 
	   4. JVM - converts byte code to executable code
	   5. JRE - responsible for what we see on UI

-More than one reference variables can point to same object 
-If any one of the reference variable changes the obejct, then the object will get changed for all references.
-Value of reference variable is stored in stack and value of object is stored in heap and the refernce 
variable points to the object which is present in heap.

-Object with no reference variable - garbage collection will come and remove this: same happens in python and java












TIM BUCHAKA:

-Class: blueprpint for creating objects.
	-State and behaviour
	-Class describes the data field(state) and behaviour(methods).
	- Instance and static fields
	-Classes are defined in groups called packages.
	-Default if package is not defined, then it belongs to default package
	
Access Modifier:
	-public: any other class in package can access this class.
	-private: no other class can access this member.
	-protected: allows classes in the same package and any other subclasses in other package to access the member
	-default: member is accessable only to class in same package.
	
Encapsulation: hiding fields and methods from public access.
				hiding information of our object from public 
				
				
Always remember instance is an object.
Fields and variables are same.

NULL- special keyword meaning variable has type but no reference to object, meaning that no object is assigned to this variable.
	- String name ="madhur;  here name is variable and some value has been assigned to it.
	-Variables are assigned default values in java.
	
-Getters and Setters: getter is a meth
od in a class which retrieves the value of private field and return it.
					  setter is a method in a class which sets the value of a private field.(can contain some more security features say if-else for data security)
					 -Purpose of these methods is to protect private variables and follow princ. of Encapsulation
					- Setters can have validation functionality hence it cannot make invalid objects.	
					
-The this keyword in Java is a reference to the current object, meaning it refers to the instance of the class in which it is used
 - When instance variables have the same name as method parameters, this helps differentiate between them
 
-Car c3 = null; //initializing instance of car with null reference, if we set anything it gives nullpointer exception at runtime.

-Constructors: used in creation of object.
				-Same name as that of class name, does not have any return type
				-Never use return type for constructor not even void
				-Specify access modifiers to control who should be able to create object for class.
				-Instead of using setter methods for setting values for object,we can use Constructors
				- Constructor is created during compilation process of java code 
		-Default constructor: if class do not contain any constructor declaration, then it is default constructor.
		-Constructor Overloading is declaring multiple constructors with different parameters.
		-Or of number of parameters of constructor is same, then their type or order should be differennt.
Constructor overloading/chaining:
	-Never call setter method in a constructor
	-Constructors are primarily used to set up initial values for the instance variables of a class. This ensures that an object starts its life in a valid state.
		
Instance vs Object vs Class vs Reference
	-Taking example of a house.
	-Class is blueprint of house.
	-Using blueprint we can build as many houses as we like.
	-each house we build using new operator is an object
	-An object can also be known as instance
	-Each house we build has an address, this is called reference. We can always copy these references as we like but still there would be same house which we would be referring to.
	-We always have reference to an object in memory, in order to access that object we always use this reference.
	- new House("Red");   -> not providing any reference hence garbageCollection will come into picture and remove this object.
	
	
Static vs Instance Variables
	-Static variable is declared using static keyword.
	-Every instance of class shares same static variable.
	-If any change is made to that variable then all other instances will see effect of that change.
	-Always use class name and not reference name to access static variable.
	-An onject/instance is not refeired to to access a static variable.
	-When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of the variable is created and shared among all objects at the class level. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.
	
Instance Variables
	-Dont use static keyword.
	-Instqance variables belong to specific instance of a class.
	
-Stativ vs Instance Methods
	-Static methods are declared with static keyword.
	-Cannot use this keyword in static method.
	-Whenever u see a method that do not use instance variables should be declared as static method.
	-Static methods do not require an instance to be created, can be directly called using class name.
	-Instance methods belongs to instance of a class.
	-To use instance methods, we first create the instance of that class by using new keyword.
-When should a method be declated Static or Instance??
	-If it contains instance variables or instance methods then declare it as instance variable, if not then static method.
	
The static keyword in Java is used to define class-level members, meaning that the static members (variables, methods, blocks, or nested classes) belong to the class itself rather than to any individual instance of the class. Here's a breakdown of the different contexts in which static can be used, along with its purpose:

1. Static Variables (Class Variables)
	-A static variable is shared among all instances of a class. All objects of that class share the same copy of the variable, and any changes made to the variable by one object are visible to all other objects.

Purpose:
	-To maintain a common property across all objects of the class.
	-Useful when memory efficiency is required, as there is only one copy of the variable, not a separate copy for each object.
	

-Java POJOs
	-Pojo or plane old java object is a class that only contains instance fields.
	-It is used to house data and pass data between functional classes.
	-It has usually no or very few methods other than getter and setter methods for instance fields.
	-Also called DTO, data transfer object and can also be recognised as java bean.
	-Usually used as when database is required to convert database fields as objects.
	
-Inheritence:
	-Way to organize classes in parent-child hierarchy which lets child inherit variables and methods from its parents.
	-eg. Animal is base class and other classes are said to be subclasses for animals.
	-Parent can have multiple child.
	-ToString method is used to print objects 
	-Using extends keyword, we declare that out subclass is child of our parent class.
	-super() is a lot like this();
	-It is a way to call a constructor on superclass directly from subclass constructor.
	

-About java.lang.Object	
	-Every class is java extends a special class called Object, hence there is always inheritence happening.
	-Hashcode is created everytime an instance is created eg. Student@5f184fc6 -> Student is my class name and following characters is the hashcode.
