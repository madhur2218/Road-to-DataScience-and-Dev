Types of languages : 
	1. Procedural - java, python
	2. Functional - python
	3. Object Oriented - java, python
	
-Statically and Dynamically typed languages:

-More than one reference variables can point to same object 
-If any one of the reference variable changes the obejct, then the object will get changed for all references.
-Value of reference variable is stored in stack and value of object is stored in heap and the refernce 
variable points to the object which is present in heap.

-Object with no reference variable - garbage collection will come and remove this: same happens in python and java

-Class: blueprpint for creating objects.
	-State and behaviour
	-Class describes the data field(state) and behaviour(methods).
	- Instance and static fields
	-Classes are defined in groups called packages.
	-Default if package is not defined, then it belongs to default package
	
Access Modifier:
	-public: any other class in package can access this class.
	-private: no other class can access this member.
	-protected: allows cla	sses in the same package and any other subclasses in other package to access the member
	-default: member is accessable only to class in same package.
	
Encapsulation: hiding fields and methods from public access.
				hiding information of our object from public 
				
				
Always remember instance is an object.
Fields and variables are same.

NULL- special keyword meaning variable has type but no reference to object, meaning that no object is assigned to this variable.
	- String name ="madhur;  here name is variable and some value has been assigned to it.
	-Variables are assigned default values in java.
	
-Getters and Setters: getter is a meth
od in a class which retrieves the value of private field and return it.
					  setter is a method in a class which sets the value of a private field.(can contain some more security features say if-else for data security)
					 -Purpose of these methods is to protect private variables and follow princ. of Encapsulation
					- Setters can have validation functionality hence it cannot make invalid objects.	
					
-The this keyword in Java is a reference to the current object, meaning it refers to the instance of the class in which it is used
 - When instance variables have the same name as method parameters, this helps differentiate between them
 
-Car c3 = null; //initializing instance of car with null reference, if we set anything it gives nullpointer exception at runtime.

-Constructors: used in creation of object.
				-Same name as that of class name, does not have any return type
				-Never use return type for constructor not even void
				-Specify access modifiers to control who should be able to create object for class.
				-Instead of using setter methods for setting values for object,we can use Constructors
				- Constructor is created during compilation process of java code 
		-Default constructor: if class do not contain any constructor declaration, then it is default constructor.
		-Constructor Overloading is declaring multiple constructors with different parameters.
		-Or of number of parameters of constructor is same, then their type or order should be differennt.
Constructor overloading/chaining:
	-Never call setter method in a constructor
	-Constructors are primarily used to set up initial values for the instance variables of a class. This ensures that an object starts its life in a valid state.
