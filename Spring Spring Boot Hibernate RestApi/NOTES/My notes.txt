Types of languages : 
	1. Procedural - java, python
	2. Functional - python
	3. Object Oriented - java, python
	
-Statically and Dynamically typed languages:

-More than one reference variables can point to same object 
-If any one of the reference variable changes the obejct, then the object will get changed for all references.
-Value of reference variable is stored in stack and value of object is stored in heap and the refernce 
variable points to the object which is present in heap.

-Object with no reference variable - garbage collection will come and remove this: same happens in python and java

-Class: blueprpint for creating objects.
	-State and behaviour
	-Class describes the data field(state) and behaviour(methods).
	- Instance and static fields
	-Classes are defined in groups called packages.
	-Default if package is not defined, then it belongs to default package
	
Access Modifier:
	-public: any other class in package can access this class.
	-private: no other class can access this member.
	-protected: allows cla	sses in the same package and any other subclasses in other package to access the member
	-default: member is accessable only to class in same package.
	
Encapsulation: hiding fields and methods from public access.
				hiding information of our object from public 
				
				
Always remember instance is an object.
Fields and variables are same.

NULL- special keyword meaning variable has type but no reference to object, meaning that no object is assigned to this variable.
	- String name ="madhur;  here name is variable and some value has been assigned to it.
	-Variables are assigned default values in java.
	
-Getters and Setters: getter is a method in a class which retrieves the value of private field and return it.
					  setter is a method in a class which sets the value of a private field.(can contain some more security features say if-else for data security)
					 -Purpose of these methods is to protect private variables and follow princ. of Encapsulation
