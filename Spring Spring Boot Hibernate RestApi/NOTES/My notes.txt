-Building a traditional spring application is very hard.
	-Which jar dependency to use
	-Which tomcat server to use
	-How to setup config. xml or spring annotations
-Spring boot helps with all above by:
	-Providing embedded http local host tomcat.
	-Resolving maven dependency
	-Minimizes use of manual configuration
-Spring boot vs Spring:
	-Spring boot used spring behind spring
	-Spring boot makes easier to to use spring
-Spring initializer:
	-Website to download spring boot dependencies.
	
-Springboot embedded server:
	-Provided embedded tomcat server, not need to install separately.
	
-Running spring boot apps:
	- .jar files contains code and server, can run using intellij or writing - java -jar mycoolapp.jar
-Deploying applications:
	-Deploying war files to external tomcat server.In that tomcat server multiple war files can be deployed.
-Maven is a build tool.
	-Instead of manually downloading dependencies, maven automatically downloads jar dependencies and make them available during complie/run time.
	
-Spring boot rest controller:
	-REST controllers play a crucial role in building web services by facilitating communication between clients and servers, enabling efficient data handling, and promoting best practices in software architecture.
	-A REST controller is a component in a web application that handles HTTP requests and responses, typically in a RESTful (Representational State Transfer) architecture. REST is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources, which are often represented in formats like JSON or XML.
	
-Spring framework overview:
	-Uses
		-Light weight dev with java pojos.
		-Dependency injection and loose coupling
		-Minimize boilerplate code
		-Core Container: beans, core etc.
		-AOP: logging, security,transactions etc.
		-Data Access Layer: JDBC, ORM(jpa, hibernate)
		-Web Layer: Servlet, websocket,web
		-Infrastructure: JMX(java management service)
		-Testing: testng, junit, mockito, integration testing
-Spring projects

-Maven: it is a devlopment build tool for java.
	-Maven also provides a standard directory structure of your project.
	-while building project u may need jar files for dependencies like hibernate,jpa etc
	-Maven automatically downloads and add these dependencies to your peoject withiut manually going to website and copying dependency and adding them to pom file.
	-How maven works:
		1.Read the config file i.e properties file.
		2.Check local maven repo on your system.
		3.Downloads properties from Maven central repository(remote)
		4.Saves these properties from remote repo to local repo.
		5.Build and run project.	
	-Pom file: project object model 
			-Group id : name of company
			-Artifact id : name of peoject
			-Version: specific release version
	-By default, spring will load properties from application.properties file.
	
-There are 30+ spring boot starters (dependencies which we place in pom file) by Spring Dev team.

-The spring-boot-starter-parent is a special Maven parent project provided by Spring Boot, used to simplify the configuration and management of a Spring Boot application. 
It includes a set of default settings and conventions that make it easier to develop and manage Spring Boot projects, especially for dependency management, plugin configuration, and version control.
	-Key Features and Benefits of spring-boot-starter-parent:
Dependency Version Management:
	-spring-boot-starter-parent includes a BOM (Bill of Materials) that manages versions for all Spring Boot-related dependencies. This means you don’t need to specify explicit versions for Spring libraries, as it provides default, compatible versions for each dependency.
		For example, if you add dependencies like spring-boot-starter-web or spring-boot-starter-data-jpa, the spring-boot-starter-parent ensures that all of these have compatible versions without you needing to manage them individually.

	
-By adding dependency of spring-bootdev-tools, we do not need to reload our project again, once code gets updated, it will automatically update my webpage change. - helps in automatic reloading.

Springboot Actuator:
	-Used to manage health of application.
	-Exposes restEng points to manage application
	-We easily get devops functionality using springboot actuator
	-We simply have to add dependency to our pom file
	-REST endpoints are automatically added to application (no need to write restEnd points again).
	-by default only /health endpoint is exposed.
	-/info provides information about your application
	-to expose /info, we make changes in application.properties file
	-/beans, /mappings, /auditevents some more endpoints
	-Sprint security: spring actuator, we dont want all of our restEndpoints to be exposed publically, hence we can use spring security actuator for this.
	
	-To build project using cmd, use: .\mvnw.cmd package, this creates jar package in target folder.
	-To run locally, use ./mvnw spring-boot:run

-Injesting cutom properties files
	-By default spring boot reads info from a standard property file ie. application.properties
	-Properties are roughly grouped as following
		-Core, web, security,data, actuator, integration, devTools, testing
		
Spring Framework:

-Inversion of Control
	-Instead of creating objects manually, we leave everything to spring.
	-Spring IoC container is a part of the Spring Framework that manages beans by instantiating, configuring, and assembling them.
	-Spring ioc container is responsible for IOC and Dependency Injection.
Configuring Spring Container:
	1. XML configuration (legacy)
	2. Java Annotations (modern)
	3. Java source code (modern)
	
	Dependency Injection: Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in software development to manage dependencies between objects. It is a form of Inversion of Control (IoC), where the responsibility of creating objects (dependencies) is transferred from a class to an external entity, often a framework or container. This helps in making the code more modular, testable, and flexible.
		-Dependency Injection reduces the need for hardcoded dependencies within classes, enhances modularity, and improves the overall flexibility and testability of your application.
		-Constructor Injection: If a class cannot function without a certain dependency, you should use constructor injection. This makes it clear that the dependency is required and enforces it at the time of object creation.
	-For dependency injection, spring can use autowiring.
	-Spring will look for class that matches class or interface.
	-Spring will inject automatically, hence called autowired.
	-Spring will scan for Component.
	-@Component annotataion marks class as a spring bean.
		-Spring bean is a regular java class managed by Spring.
		-Spring provides features like: database access and transactions, Rest api and web MVC, Security etc.
	-@SpringBootApplication comprises of the following:
		1.@EnableAutoConfiguration: enables spring boot auto config support.
		2.@Component: enables component scanning for current package and recursively scans sub-packages.
		3.@Configuration: [DOUBT]
	-By default spring boot starts component scanning for same package as your spring boot application and scans sub packages recursively.
	-Component scanning works for base package but for Scanning other packages we need to define this manually.
	-Setter injection: setting injection only based on using setter methods in class.
	-Constructor injection: required dependencies.
	-Setter injection: optional dependencies.
	-Field Inkection- not recommended as it makes difficult to write UT.(FIELD INJECTION USES JAVA REFLECTION)

Qualifiers:
	-@Qualifier annotation is used in Spring to resolve ambiguity when multiple beans of the same type exist.
	
Primary
	-@Primary is an alternative for @Qualifier, but Primary can only have only one for multiple implementations.
	-We cannot mark multiple classes with @Primary.
	-We can mix @Primary and @Qualifier together but @Qualifier will have higer priority.
	
Lazy Initialization:
	-Only creates objects when needed.
	-Helps with faster startup time when there are large number of components.
	
Bean Scopes - refers to lifecycle of a bean.
	-Means how long does the bean live.
	=How many instances are being created
	-How is bean shared.
	-Default scope is singleton meaning spring container creates only one instance of bean by default and is cashed in memory.
	-Singleton: cretes a single shared instance of a bean. Default scope.
	-Prototype: creates new bean instance for eash container request.
	-Request, Session: scoped for http request only.
	
In Java, @PostConstruct is an annotation used to indicate that a method should be executed after dependency injection is done on a bean but before the bean is put into service.
Key Points:
	Purpose:
	It allows you to perform any necessary initialization tasks, such as setting up default values, connecting to external resources, or performing calculations, after the bean's dependencies have been injected.
	Lifecycle:
	The @PostConstruct method is called only once in the bean's lifecycle, immediately after the bean is created and its dependencies have been injected.
	Usage:
	You can annotate only one method per class with @PostConstruct. The method must not have any parameters and must not return a value.
